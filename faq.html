        <h2>WHEN WILL YOU SHIP MY ORDER?</h2>

        <p>We'll ship your order as soon as humanly possible. That being said, we ship orders for roasted coffee when it's freshest - just after it's been roasted and packed. Orders placed before midnight on Thursday will ship on Friday, and orders placed through the weekend will ship on Monday.</p>
      <p>We ship all our orders via USPS and you'll be furnished with your tracking information as soon as it's available. If you're in a hurry and need your order sooner, please choose an expedited shipping option at checkout.</p>
     <p>In the case that a part of your order may be out of stock or on backorder we'll notify you immediately to determine your preferred course of action. 

 </p>

 <h2>WAIT, SO ALL YOUR BEANS ARE FROM NICARAGUA?!</h2>
 <p>Yes! However, it's not as simple as that - we source our coffees extensively throughout four of Nicaragua's principal coffee producing regions. In the course of a year we'll feature over thirty unique lots, each with their own distinct characteristics and profiles.</p>

<h2>ARE YOUR COFFEES FAIR TRADE, CERTIFIED ORGANIC, ETC...?</h2>
 <p>All of our beans are sourced personally and we pay many times over the Fair Trade price. They are all shade-grown, bird-friendly, and grown ethically with the use of ecological fertilizers and compost. While most of our lots are grown organically, very few of them are certified - a costly add-on that growers are rarely able to afford. Many of our coffees are Rainforest Alliance Certified which is one of the most thorough and valid of certification systems - they'll be noted as such in their descriptions.</p>
 <p>Read more about the Rainforest Alliance here.</p>
<h2>HOW LONG WILL MY BEANS KEEP?</h2>
 <p>Freshly roasted coffee goes through an aging and staling process just like anything else. We recommend consuming your beans within twenty days of your roast date. Of course, the coffee will never go bad so feel free to take as long as you need!</p>
<h2>HOW SHOULD I STORE MY ROASTED COFFEE? </h2>
 <p>Our roasted coffee comes packaged in barrier bags fitted with one-way gas valves to conserve freshness. Keep your coffee in a cool and dark place away from heat or sunlight. Contrary to popular belief, coffee should never be refrigerated. If you intend to keep your roasted coffee longer than thirty days after it has been roasted, it may be beneficial to freeze it in airtight sealed bags (tight ziplock will do). In this case we recommend that you only thaw your beans once ready to use and avoid bringing them in and out of freezing temperatures. 

</p>
<h2>WHICH BREWER IS BEST?</h2>
 <p>We don't believe there's any one brewer that's perfect for everyone. We do, however, brew tons of coffee everyday and have logged hundreds of hours on just about every apparatus out there. If you're brewing at home, for yourself or one other we'd recommend a pour-over setup to start like the Kalita or Chemex brewers.</p>
 <p>Our gear section is a greatest-hits selection of our favorite tools. </p>
<h2>DO YOU SELL GREEN COFFEE?

</h2>
 <p>Of course! We regularly work with roasters across the country who would like to get their hands on some unique Nicaraguan coffees. Home roasters too! </p>
 <p>Drop us a line for our latest green offering sheet.</p>
